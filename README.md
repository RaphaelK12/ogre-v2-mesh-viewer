# ogre-v2-mesh-viewer

A simple Ogre3D mesh viewer based on v2.1 which can import/export obj models 


## TODO

- [ ] Improve performance by converting obj data to ogre mesh directly. (Currently it uses mesh.xml as intermediate data format)
- [x] Automatically generate normals if there are no normal vectors in obj
